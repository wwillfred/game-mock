# First-game
This is the public repository for my first computer game. I am building the game in Unity and am designing it as a top-down, 2D, monochromatic game, heavily inspired by the design of the original Link's Awakening. The game will only be around ten minutes in length.

### Mockup
I completed the first milestone of building a mockup of basic game mechanics in early 2022. Features in this mock-up include fixed-camera views, collision detection, and interaction. All assets were found online. For fun, I created a [Kubernetes manifest for deploying this mockup in an NGinx web server running in a Docker Container in Azure Kubernetes Service](https://github.com/wwillfred/Unity-WebGL-Kubernetes).

### Creating my own assets
Now I am focused on creating [my own assets](/Assets/Sprites) so I can verify the feasibility of the aesthetic I want to create. 

Feel free to clone this project and build yourself in Unity. Please give credit for all assets I've created in this project. Thank you.
